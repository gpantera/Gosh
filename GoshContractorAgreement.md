5. During the work week, Contractor will respond to Company emails in less than 24 hours. 

6. Contractor will update Trello status board daily to track changes. (See GoshReports.md for instructions how to update board.)

7. Contractor will check-in work daily. That's to git, to WordPress, or another location as directed.

End-of-day progress reports will generally be expected at ___[You fill this in: Specify a time that's normally the end of your business day, so we know when to expect your reports.  California PST, that is, GMT -8, not your local time.]___ PST.

9. Contractor will follow the Company style guidelines.

10. Contractor is not authorized to go over budget. If Contractor thinks that the tasks specified will exceed the budget or become unreasonable effort, the Contractor will stop work immediately and inform the Company. Company policy for workers who expect to be paid for unauthorized cost overruns is termination. 

11. If Contractor has underbid, inform the Company immediately. Maybe adjustments can be made. What task was a surprise? Why is it taking more effort than the Contractor expected? With hindsight, what should have been Contractor's bid?

12. Contractor is not authorized to change the design spec. Not all design choices can be documented in the original spec. In order to build what the Company wants, the Contractor must ask questions.

13. No payment for a sprint half done. If Contractor disappears or can't complete in a timely way, any effort he or she may have started on the current sprint will not be compensated.

14. At completion of the sprint, Contractor will invoice the Company by email with a message stating what project, what sprint, what amount, and by what method the Contractor prefers to be paid. Complete means all features implemented per sprint's design spec. That's sufficient invoice for Paypal. To be paid on Guru Contractor will also need to create an invoice there.

15. Payment due upon verification of sprint. Verification means work passes Company SQA. Company policy is to pay promptly, not to age invoices.
