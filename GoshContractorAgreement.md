## Sprint Bid Instructions

Bid by email. Paste this agreement into your bid. Fill in the blanks below with your details. Do not break payments into milestones. Bid for the entire sprint. The Company typically manages work in 1-week sprints.

## Sprint Terms

The following terms apply to all work done with us, unless there is an agreement in writing otherwise.

1. All work is a work-for-hire that belongs to the Company Gosh!TV.

2. Contractor ___[You fill this in: Your name]___ will keep confidential the Company's confidential business plans and trade secrets.

3. For tax purposes, Contractor is a citizen of ___[You fill this in: Country]___ and is based in ___[You fill this in: Country]___.

4. The Company is results-driven and does not monitor the hours Contractor works. If Contractor needs a day off or has an emergency that stops work for the day, Contractor will inform the Company as soon as feasible.

5. During the work week, Contractor will respond to Company emails in less than 24 hours. 

6. Contractor will update Trello status board daily to track changes. (See GoshReports.md for instructions how to update board.)

7. Contractor will check-in work daily. That's to git, to WordPress, or another location as directed.

8. Contractor will email daily progress updates Monday to Friday, a note saying what's done and what he or she is implementing next. End-of-day progress reports will generally be expected at ___[You fill this in: Specify a time that's normally the end of your business day, so we know when to expect your reports.  California PST, that is, GMT -8, not your local time.]___ PST.

9. Contractor will follow the Company style guidelines.

10. Contractor is not authorized to go over budget. If Contractor thinks that the tasks specified will exceed the budget or become unreasonable effort, the Contractor will stop work immediately and inform the Company. Company policy for workers who expect to be paid for unauthorized cost overruns is termination. 

11. If Contractor has underbid, inform the Company immediately. Maybe adjustments can be made. What task was a surprise? Why is it taking more effort than the Contractor expected? With hindsight, what should have been Contractor's bid?

12. Contractor is not authorized to change the design spec. Not all design choices can be documented in the original spec. In order to build what the Company wants, the Contractor must ask questions.

13. No payment for a sprint half done. If Contractor disappears or can't complete in a timely way, any effort he or she may have started on the current sprint will not be compensated.

14. Payment due upon completion and verification of sprint. At completion of the sprint, Contractor will invoice the Company by email with a message stating what project, what sprint, what amount, and by what method the Contractor prefers to be paid. Complete means all features implemented per sprint's design spec. Verification means work passes Company SQA. Company policy is to pay promptly, not to age invoices.
