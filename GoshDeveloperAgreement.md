2016/12/18 rev. 1

1. Development is a work-for-hire that belongs to the Company Gosh.

2. Contractor will keep confidential the Company's confidential business plans and trade secrets.

3. Contractor will email daily progress updates Monday to Friday, a note saying what's done and what he or she is implementing next. Contractor will update Trello status daily to track changes.

4. No payment for a sprint half done. If Contractor disappears or can't complete in a timely way, any effort he or she may have started on the current sprint will not be compensated.

5. Payment due upon completion of sprint. If the Contractor completes early, Company pays early. Complete means all features implemented per sprint's design spec and software passes Company SQA (typically takes less than 48 hours).

## Bid Procedure

Please paste our developer agreement above into your bid. Set completion date to be one week later than when you expect to be code complete, so we have time for testing. Do not break payments into milestones. Bid for the entire sprint.
