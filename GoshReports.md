## Summary

At the end of your workday for Gosh, send us an email and update your Trello project status. Progress emails are expected nightly on weekdays. If you're not doing anything for Gosh that day, send an email to let us know. If you work on a weekend day, send an email then, too. 

Don't stress out. If you encounter an obstacle, let us know.
