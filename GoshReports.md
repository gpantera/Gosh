Don't stress out. If you encounter an obstacle, let us know.

## Progress Email

Give a concise update of what was completed today and what you're working on next.

## Gosh Trello Color-coding

- Yellow: Underway
- Red: Obstacle encountered
- Green: Done, checked in, and ready for testing by SQA 
- Black: Will not be implemented

## Displaying Status in Trello

We use Trello kanban in a very lightweight way, spend little time at it. However, it is important.

We're not using the typical Kanban schema of Backlog-Sprinting-Testing-Done, where you drag a task/card to the right to show progress in time. 

Each column is simply one product sprint. Each card is a task. Don't move cards between columns. Simply update the color label to show status. It works like a systems indicator dashboard. The color-coding system is based on the red-yellow-green of traffic lights. When you first look at your sprint in Trello, mark every task as blue, unless you don't understand what it means or what to do with that task.

Typically no comments need to be added. What few comments we use are reference links, such as a link to a relevant Internet standard. 

As you go, add any new task that has status. Every card in a sprint/product column you are working on should have a color indicating your status with it. When a task is not on the board or not color-coded, we will get confused what you're doing. It should take under 2 minutes daily for you to keep your trello columns up to date. For developers working on only one product during a sprint, you will only have one column to update. A column will typically have 10 to 20 tasks.
