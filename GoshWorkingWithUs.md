# Working with Us

By Robin Rowe 2017/1/1 rev. 2017/1/5

We organize development tasks into 1-week sprints.

## Hiring Process

Make your bid on Guru. We will contact you to ask for your resume if you are a top candidate.

## Deliverables

Progress reports (a brief email), and code check-ins to git, are due at the end of each work day. That is, every weekday during your development. 

## Schedule

Development per our design spec should take about a week. Add one week to the your expected completion date to allow us time to do testing. If you need to bid as taking longer, because you have other projects, that's fine. By the way, if we get done early, we pay early. If the progress we have planned seems too high, you may be imagining a solution that's more sophisticated than what we need. If a task seems too hard, ask.

## Testing

Developer is expected to desk-check his code and commit changes to git daily. We do SQA at the end of the sprint, sometimes during sprint. Our SQA test cycle normally takes 48 hours and expects to find about a dozen bugs or minor missing features or spec misunderstandings/omissions. Typically, the developer can fix all these in less than a day. Second SQA cycle after bug-fixes expects to find a few nitpicks. Normally able to sign off after third SQA tests. 

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Bid an amount greater than our stated budget or make a "placeholder" bid.

2. Create a bid that offers no details of why to hire you.

3. Not have your actual name show in your profile.

4. Not show your own headshot in your profile.

5. Refuse to provide your resume.

6. Refuse to provide references.

7. Be difficult by taking too many go-backs for a task that could have been done-in-one.

8. Be unresponsive by taking longer than a business day to respond to messages.

9. Be unreliable or forgetful by not doing what you said you would do.
