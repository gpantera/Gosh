## Trello

Trello does not have a field for deadline. We are using the Due Date field instead. The deadline is the date the article goes live. Your deadline to complete drafting an article is two days before the release deadline.

1. List all articles on Trello first. 
2. Arrange cards in date order.
3. Move to draft column when posted draft is up at HDS.  

## Article Style Guide

### Title

If Hallmark, make sure title includes either Hallmark or Hallmark M&M then movie name. 

### Subhead 

1. Say in a sound-bite what the plot is
2. Then: Date time and time zone where it premieres
3. The date it premieres with the ordinal format, e.g., 14th or 3rd
4. The time it premieres ET and PT PT will be three hours before ET time, e.g., "8pm ET, 6pm PT"
5. Subheads never end in a period, although they read like a sentence
6. Always bold
7. Film and series titles are always italicized
8. If applicable, spell out the network name in subhead, e.g., Hallmark Movies & Mysteries

HOLLYWOOD, CA (Hollywood Daily Star) 2017/1/12 – “First sentence of quote goes here,” says ___Superstore___ star America Ferrera. “Always place the details on who is speaking after the first sentence. If there is more then one sentence after that is fine.” 

Name of movie or TV show italicized with website link attached. That’s the network's website for the show, not IMDB.

### Article Checklist

1. Female lead with wikipedia page link attached to their name  https://www.wikipedia.org/ 

1. Male lead name with wikipedia page link attached to their name  https://www.wikipedia.org/

1. Make sure all hot links are set to “Open in new Window” click on the little settings icon. A new window will open. Check box there and save. (May not be able to do this until we add feature to Word Press.)

1. When starting paragraph about show, start with title of show or movie then the actors’ name the character name. No parenthesis in these paragraphs. Example: In Finding Father Christmas, Erin Krakow is Seattle interior designer Miranda Chester…

1. Check if based on a book, especially for Hallmark. Look up title in Amazon. If so, include The author and if the name of the book is different from the title of the Movie. Also Include any author website links. Example: Based on the book by Robin Jones Gunn. Gunn has a series of father Christmas books.

1. The stars names will appear in paragraph form, with the characters names in parenthesis, along with the production company, then producers and directors and writers, all sentence format.

1. The network description should be only two sentences, and will be attached to the paragraph above. **Depending on if it’s a Hallmark Movie & Mysteries movie or regular Hallmark movie, switch which goes first** For Hallmark, use the two-sentence Hallmark description: Hallmark Movies & Mysteries and Hallmark Channel are owned by Crown Media Family Networks.  They are distributed to 66 million U.S. homes.

1. Include the twitter handles of the movie names, actors, network. If not included in the PR release go to twitter and get.
