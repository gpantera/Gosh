## Trello

Trello is not have a field for deadline. We are using the Due Date field instead. The deadline is the date the article goes live. The deadline to complete drafting an article is two days before the deadline.

1. List all articles on Trello first. 
2. Arrange cards in date order.
3. Move to draft column when posted draft is up at HDS.  

## Article Style Guide

### Title

If Hallmark, make sure title includes either Hallmark or Hallmark M&M then movie name. 

### Subhead 

1. Say in a sound-bite what the plot is
2. Then: Date time and time zone where it premieres
3. The date it premieres with the ordinal format, e.g., 14th or 3rd
4. The time it premieres ET and PT PT will be three hours before ET time, e.g., "8pm ET, 6pm PT"
5. Subheads never end in a period, although they read like a sentence
6. Always bold
7. Film and series titles are always italicized
8. If applicable, spell out the network name in subhead, e.g., Hallmark Movies & Mysteries

HOLLYWOOD, CA (Hollywood Daily Star) 2017/1/12 – “First sentence of quote goes here,” says ___Superstore___ star America Ferrara. “Always place the details on who is speaking after the first sentence. If there is more then one sentence after that is fine.” 

Name of movie or TV show italicized with website link attached. That’s the network's website for the show, not IMDB.

### Article Checklist
